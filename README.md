# What is this

Book of Shifting Antiquity is an attempt to make a self-generating hypertext "wiki" of a fantasy world.

Each page is generated randomly but in a fixed way based on it's URL, so visiting a page on different device will be the same. Generation is all performed client-side, when the page is loaded. The proejct is written in React using React Router and Tracery for the content generation.
